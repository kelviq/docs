### Payout schedule
Choose how often you want to receive funds.
* **Automatic:** Set transfers to occur daily, weekly, or monthly.
* **Manual:** Funds sit in your account until you explicitly click "Withdraw."

### Thresholds & Timing
* **Thresholds:** Set a minimum amount required before a payout is triggered (e.g. only pay me out when I hit $100).
* **Timing:** If you select weekly or monthly, you can adjust the specific day of the week or date of the month for the transfer.
