Kelviq provides a hosted customer portal.

This is a self-serve environment. Your customers manage their own subscriptions, access files, and handle billing details. You don't need to build this. It ensures you don't have to manually answer support tickets for basic tasks like upgrading plans or downloading invoices.

## Access and login

The portal uses passwordless, secure access.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Purchase and invite">
    When a customer completes a purchase, they get access immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Login">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure entry">
    We send a one-time access code to their email. They enter this code to log in. No passwords to remember.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Usage tracking
For metered products, customers see real-time data. They can track API calls, storage used, or any metric you bill for. This transparency helps prevent billing disputes.
