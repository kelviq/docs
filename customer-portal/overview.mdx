Kelviq provides a fully hosted customer portal out of the box.

This is a self-serve environment where your customers can manage their own subscriptions, access files, and handle billing details. You do not need to build any of this yourself. It ensures you don't have to manually handle support tickets for basic tasks like upgrading plans or downloading invoices.

## Access & authentication

The portal allows passwordless, secure access.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure entry">
    We send a one-time access code to their email. They enter this code to log in securely without needing to remember a password.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What customers can do

Once logged in, the dashboard is divided into three core sections.

### My orders
This is the home for everything the customer owns. They can click on any specific product to see the details.

* **Digital downloads**
  Access and download files, e-books, or software binaries immediately.
* **External links**
  Access private links to communities (Discord) or Notion templates.
* **License management**
  View license keys. If you enforce seat limits, customers can view which devices are active and remotely revoke licenses to free up seats for new team members.
* **Usage tracking**
  For metered products, customers can view real-time usage graphs. They can track API calls, storage used, or any other metric you bill for.

### Subscription management
Customers have full control over their lifecycle without contacting support.

* **Change plans**
  Upgrade to a higher tier or downgrade to a lower one.
* **Pause & cancel**
  Pause a subscription temporarily or cancel it entirely.
* **Payment methods**
  Update credit card details or switch payment methods for future renewals.

### Billing & settings
A dedicated section for compliance and account administration.

* **Invoices & receipts**
  View payment history. Customers can download PDF invoices and receipts for their own accounting.
* **Refund status**
  Track the status of partial or full refunds.
* **Account details**
  Update billing addresses and tax IDs.
* **Account transfer**
  Transfer the ownership of the account and subscription to another email address.
