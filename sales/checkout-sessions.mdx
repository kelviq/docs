While the **Orders** page tracks successful revenue, the **Checkout Sessions** page tracks every single attempt.

This is your granular, real-time log of what is happening on your payment page right now. It is essential for debugging failed transactions and recovering abandoned carts.

## Accessing sessions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate">
    Go to **Sales > Checkout sessions** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Filter">
    Use the status tabs to isolate specific types of traffic:
    * **Open:** Customers currently on the payment page.
    * **Succeeded:** Completed purchases.
    * **Failed:** Declined cards or errors.
    * **Expired:** Sessions where the customer left without paying.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Session details

Click on any session to see the raw data. This is useful if you need to understand *why* a transaction failed (e.g. "Card expired" vs "Insufficient funds").
