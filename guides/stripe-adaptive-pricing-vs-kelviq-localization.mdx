## Stripe vs kelviq: What's the Difference?
**Stripe Adaptive Pricing** automatically localizes prices on its own **hosted checkout, payment links, and invoices**. But that’s where it ends; these prices are not visible on your site or landing pages.

**kelviq** builds on top of Stripe by letting you:
- Show localized product prices directly on your **custom website**
- Detect **visitor location**, convert currency, and apply region based pricing
- Prevent abuse using **VPN, proxy, and Tor detection**
- Integrate with your UI using components like `<KQPricingTable>` and `<KQPrice>`
- Make changes from the dashboard (no redeploy required)

## Capability Comparison
| Capability | Stripe Adaptive Pricing | kelviq Localization | Notes |
|------------|:------------------------:|:-------------------------:|-------|
| Auto currency conversion | ✅ | ✅ | Based on IP, both detect visitor location |
| Works on hosted checkout | ✅ | ✅ | Stripe only supports its hosted pages |
| Works on your own website | ❌ | ✅ | kelviq shows localized prices before checkout |
| Works with subscriptions | ❌ | ✅ | Stripe supports only one time payments |
| Pricing UI components | ❌ | ✅ | `<KQPricingTable>`, `<KQPrice>`, and SDK API |
| Dashboard to manage localization | ❌ | ✅ | Configure geo rules without code |
| Detects VPN, proxy, Tor | ❌ | ✅ | Protects from discounted abuse |
| JS SDK for dynamic pricing | ❌ | ✅ | Lightweight and async |
| No deploy needed for updates | ✅ | ✅ | Both support config-based updates |

## Example Use Case
Let’s say you sell a SaaS product at **$9 USD**. You want to show **₹500 INR** to Indian users **before** they hit checkout.

### Stripe (Adaptive Pricing)
Stripe shows local currency only on checkout or payment link:

```text
✅ On hosted checkout, Indian user sees ₹500  
❌ On your website: user still sees $9
```

No frontend API or SDK is available to show the adjusted amount before checkout.

---

### kelviq (Localized on Your Site)

You can use the kelviq SDK and components to display region specific pricing

```tsx
import { KQPricingTable, KQPrice } from '@kelviq/react-ui';

<KelviqProvider
    accessToken={process.env.Kelviq_ACCESS_TOKEN}
>
    // Automatically uses the price from the current region
    <KQPricingTable />
</KelviqProvider>

// Or use inline price rendering
// Automatically uses the price from the current region
<KQPrice />
```

```text
✅ Users in India will see ₹500 (if your pricing rule sets it)
✅ Users from the US will still see $9
```

---

## VPN / Proxy / Tor Detection

Stripe’s adaptive pricing **does not block users** using VPNs or anonymizing networks. That means users can **spoof locations** to access lower pricing.

kelviq includes:

* VPN detection via IP analysis and blacklist services
* Proxy server detection
* Tor network flagging

If abuse is detected:

* Prices can fall back to the base region
* Localization rules are skipped
* Logs available in the dashboard for review
