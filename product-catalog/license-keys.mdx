License keys are a powerful way to authenticate and authorize usage of your software products. Kelviq can automatically generate unique license keys for each customer purchase, including activation limits and expiration dates.

## Overview

When you enable license key generation for a plan, Kelviq will:
- Generate a unique license key for each customer purchase
- Enforce activation limits (number of devices/installations)
- Track activation timestamps
- Handle automatic expiration
- Provide easy revocation on refunds

License keys work great for:
- Desktop software licensing
- SaaS seat-based access
- Enterprise software deployments
- Multi-device software licenses

## Enabling License Keys for a Plan

License keys are configured at the plan level. Each plan can have different license settings.

### Steps to Enable

1. **Go to your plan** → Open the plan you want to add licensing to
2. **Find the "License" tab** → Scroll to the License section
3. **Toggle "Generate License Keys"** → Enable the feature
4. **Configure settings** (see below)
5. **Save plan**

### License Configuration Options

<Card title="Activation Limit" icon="lock">
  Controls the maximum number of times a license can be activated.
  - **Minimum:** 1 (license can only be used on one device)
  - **Default:** No limit
  - Enable the toggle to enforce a specific activation limit
</Card>

<Card title="Duration & Expiry" icon="hourglass">
  Controls when a license expires.
  - **Duration Value:** A number (1, 5, 30, etc.)
  - **Duration Unit:** Day, Week, Month, or Year
  - **Example:** 1 Year = license expires after 12 months of activation
  - Disable to allow perpetual (non-expiring) licenses
</Card>

## License Configuration Examples

### Example 1: Perpetual License

Use case: Customers buy "lifetime" access to your software

```
Activation Limit: Enabled - 2
Expiry: Disabled (no expiration)
```

Result: License can be activated on 2 devices and never expires.

### Example 2: Annual Subscription License

Use case: Customers subscribe and get annual access

```
Activation Limit: Disabled (unlimited activations)
Duration: 1 Year
```

Result: License can be activated on unlimited devices but expires after 1 year.

### Example 3: Single-Device License

Use case: Customers buy a license for a single computer

```
Activation Limit: Enabled - 1
Duration: Disabled (no expiration)
```

Result: License can only be activated once and never expires.

### Example 4: Team License

Use case: Team of 5 people get access to your software

```
Activation Limit: Enabled - 5
Duration: 1 Year
```

Result: License can be activated on 5 devices and expires after 1 year.

## How Licenses Are Generated

### Purchase Flow

1. **Customer purchases** → Completes checkout for a plan with licensing enabled
2. **License generated** → Kelviq automatically creates a unique license key
3. **Customer notified** → License key sent via email and available in order details
4. **Customer activates** → Customer uses the license key to activate your software

### License Key Format

License keys are generated as unique identifiers with the format:
```
XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
```

Example:
```
A7F2-9K4L-5M8N-2P9Q
```

Each license key is unique per order. Customers cannot reuse the same key across multiple orders.

## Accessing License Keys

### For Customers

Customers can view their license keys in the Kelviq dashboard:

1. **Order details** → Click on their purchase order
2. **License section** → View the license key with copy button
3. **Current activations** → See how many devices the license is activated on

### Via API

Retrieve license information programmatically:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from kelviq_sdk import KelviqClient

    client = KelviqClient(api_key="your_server_key")

    # Get order details with license info
    order = client.orders.get(order_id="ord_123")

    if order.license:
        print(f"License Key: {order.license['license_key']}")
        print(f"Activated on: {order.license['activated_on']}")
        print(f"Expires on: {order.license['expires_on']}")
        print(f"Current activations: {order.license['current_activation_count']}")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const { KelviqClient } = require('kelviq-sdk');

    const client = new KelviqClient({ apiKey: 'your_server_key' });

    const order = await client.orders.get('ord_123');

    if (order.license) {
      console.log(`License Key: ${order.license.license_key}`);
      console.log(`Activated: ${order.license.current_activation_count} times`);
      console.log(`Expires: ${order.license.expires_on}`);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## License Validation in Your Software

To use license keys, you'll need to validate them in your application. Kelviq provides SDKs for this purpose.

### Validate License on Startup

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from kelviq_sdk import KelviqClient

    client = KelviqClient(api_key="your_server_key")

    def validate_license(license_key):
        try:
            # Validate and get license details
            license_data = client.licenses.validate(license_key)

            if license_data['status'] == 'active':
                print("License is valid!")
                return True
            else:
                print(f"License is {license_data['status']}")
                return False

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"License validation failed: {e}")
            return False

    # In your app startup
    if validate_license("A7F2-9K4L-5M8N-2P9Q"):
        # License valid, allow app to run
        run_application()
    else:
        # License invalid, show error
        show_license_error()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const { KelviqClient } = require('kelviq-sdk');

    const client = new KelviqClient({ apiKey: 'your_server_key' });

    async function validateLicense(licenseKey) {
      try {
        const licenseData = await client.licenses.validate(licenseKey);

        if (licenseData.status === 'active') {
          console.log('License is valid!');
          return true;
        } else {
          console.log(`License is ${licenseData.status}`);
          return false;
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('License validation failed:', error);
        return false;
      }
    }

    // In your app startup
    const isValid = await validateLicense('A7F2-9K4L-5M8N-2P9Q');
    if (isValid) {
      runApplication();
    } else {
      showLicenseError();
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## License Lifecycle

### States

**Active**
- License is valid and can be used
- Activation count is below limit (if enforced)
- Expiration date is in the future (if set)

**Expired**
- License duration has passed
- Cannot be activated or used

**Revoked**
- License was revoked due to refund or cancellation
- Cannot be used

**Deactivated**
- Customer deactivated the license on a device
- Device no longer has access

### Activation Tracking

Each time a user activates a license on a device:
- Activation count increases
- Activation timestamp is recorded
- If activation limit is reached, no further activations allowed

## Refunds and License Revocation

When a customer's order is refunded:

1. **License status changes** → License is marked as revoked
2. **Activations stopped** → New activations are rejected
3. **Running instances** → Existing running instances may continue until restart (backend dependent)
4. **Validation fails** → License key validation returns "revoked" status

<Warning>
  Your application should periodically validate licenses (e.g., on app startup, daily check) to ensure revoked licenses are detected.
</Warning>

## Licensing Best Practices

### Security

- **Validate server-side** - Always validate licenses on your servers, not just client-side
- **Hash license keys** - Don't log or transmit license keys in plain text
- **Secure storage** - Store license keys securely (encrypted) if saving locally
- **Periodic validation** - Re-validate licenses periodically, not just on first run

### User Experience

- **Clear messaging** - Show why a license is invalid (expired, revoked, wrong key)
- **Grace period** - Consider a grace period for expired licenses (e.g., 7-day warning)
- **Help links** - Provide links to get a new license or contact support
- **Easy input** - Make license key input easy (copy/paste, auto-formatting)

### Business

- **Trial licenses** - Create separate plans for trials with short expiry (e.g., 14-30 days)
- **Upgrade path** - Make it easy for customers to upgrade their license
- **Multiple licenses** - Allow customers to purchase multiple licenses for different devices/teams
- **Renewal reminders** - Send email reminders before licenses expire

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="Can a customer get a new license key if they lose theirs?">
  No, license keys are tied to orders. Customers should keep their license keys safe. You could implement a "license recovery" feature in your app that lets customers prove ownership and retrieve their key.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if a customer reinstalls or updates their software?">
  As long as the activation limit hasn't been reached, they can reactivate on the same device. Consider providing a way to deactivate and reactivate.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I disable or revoke a specific license manually?">
  Not through the dashboard. However, you can revoke licenses via API using your server key if needed for support cases.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do license keys require internet connectivity?">
  Kelviq doesn't enforce this, but best practice is to validate licenses online periodically. You might allow offline usage with periodic sync as a fallback.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have licenses with no activation limit?">
  Yes, leave the "Activation Limit" toggle disabled. The license can be activated unlimited times.
</Accordion>
