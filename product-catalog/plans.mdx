A plan is the commercial package you offer to customers. It bundles your pricing logic with the actual value you deliver, such as software downloads, community access, or feature limits.

You can create multiple plans for a single product. For example, you might have a "Starter" plan for hobbyists and a "Pro" plan for businesses.

## Plan structure

Every plan consists of configurable components that define what the user gets.

## Plan lifecycle

You manage plans through a simple status flow.

* **Draft**
    The default state for new plans. These are not visible to customers.
* **Published**
    The plan is live and checkout is enabled.
* **Unpublished changes**
    A draft version of an existing published plan. You are editing a copy, so your live plan remains safe until you hit publish again.
* **Archived**
    The plan is hidden from new customers but remains active for existing subscribers.

## Configure pricing

### Free vs. Paid
Use the toggle in the top right to switch between a free or paid plan.

</Frame>
* **Free plan:** Users are not charged. Useful for lead magnets or open-source tiers.
* **Paid plan:** Unlocks the billing configuration options below.

### Billing cycles
Select the intervals you want to offer. You can enable multiple intervals for a single plan.
<Frame>
  <img height="200" src="/images/billing-cycle.png" />
</Frame>
* **Monthly / Yearly:** Standard recurring subscriptions.
* **3 Months:** Quarterly billing.
* **One time:** A single non-recurring payment (lifetime deal).

### Regional pricing
You can set specific prices for different regions rather than relying on auto-conversion.
1. Click **+ Add Region**.
2. Select the currency (e.g. EUR, INR).
3. Enter the price for that market.

## Add deliverables

Configure what the customer receives immediately after purchase. These assets are delivered directly via the customer portal or email.

### Digital downloads
Upload files that are securely delivered after purchase.
1. Expand the **Digital downloads** accordion.
2. Drag and drop your files (up to 5GB total).
3. Customers will see these in their portal immediately after checkout.

### License keys
If you are selling software that requires activation, you can issue unique license keys.
1. Expand the **License keys** accordion.
2. **Activation limit:** Set how many machines or instances can use a single key (e.g. 1 for personal, 5 for team).
3. **License duration:** Define how long the key remains valid (e.g. 1 Year).

### External links
Provide access to resources hosted elsewhere.
1. Expand the **Links** accordion.
2. Add the **Link name** (e.g. Private Discord community).
3. Add the **Link URL**.

## Feature & limits
Configure feature access, usage quotas, and API limits.

* **Toggle features:** Turn specific capabilities on or off (e.g. "SSO Access").
* **Numeric limits:** Set quotas (e.g. "5 Projects", "10,000 API calls").

## Publishing & Versioning

We protect your live customers by creating a separate version when you edit a plan.

### How it works
* **Safe editing**
    When you edit a **Published** plan, we automatically create a new **Unpublished** version. Your live plan remains untouched so customers can keep buying without interruption.
* **Unpublished changes**
    You will see a yellow badge indicating you are working on a draft version. You can make as many changes as you want here without affecting the live site.
* **Publishing**
    When you click **Publish**, this new version replaces the old one.

### Pushing updates
Because the new version replaces the old one, you need to decide what happens to your current subscribers.

When you click **Publish**, we will ask you to confirm the rollout strategy.
* **For price changes:** You decide whether to grandfather existing users on the old price or migrate them to the new one.
* **For feature changes:** You decide whether to push the new entitlements to existing users immediately or keep them on their legacy configuration.

If you change your mind while editing, you can click **Discard** to delete the unpublished version and revert to the live state.
