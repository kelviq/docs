Entitlements define what features and functionality your customers can access based on their plan. Kelviq handles automatic entitlement creation and enforcement.

## Understanding Entitlements

An **entitlement** is a customer's right to use a feature. When a customer purchases a plan, Kelviq automatically creates entitlements for all features linked to that plan.

**Example:**
- Plan: "Professional ($29/month)"
- Features in plan: "Priority support", "Custom branding", "10 projects"
- Customer purchases plan → Customer gets entitlements for all 3 features

## Entitlement Types

Features in Kelviq can be configured as different types, each with different entitlement behaviors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Boolean (Switch)" icon="toggle-on">
    On/off features. Either the customer has access or doesn't.

    Example: "Priority support", "Custom branding"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customizable" icon="sliders">
    Features with numeric limits that you define per plan.

    Example: "Max projects" (5, 10, unlimited)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Checking Entitlements in Your App

Your application needs to check entitlements before allowing customers to use features.

### Check if Customer Has Access

Use `hasAccess` to quickly check if a customer can use a feature:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from kelviq_sdk import Kelviq

    client = Kelviq.create_sync_client(access_token="your_server_api_key")

    # Check if customer has access to a feature
    has_access = client.entitlements.has_access(
        customerId="unique-customer-001",
        featureId="priority-support"
    )

    if has_access:
        # Grant access to the feature
        print("Customer has access to priority support")
    else:
        # Show upgrade prompt
        print("Upgrade required for priority support")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { Kelviq } from '@kelviq/node-sdk';

    const client = new Kelviq({ accessToken: 'your_server_api_key' });

    // Check if customer has access to a feature
    const hasAccess = await client.entitlements.hasAccess({
        customerId: "unique-customer-001",
        featureId: "priority-support"
    });

    if (hasAccess) {
        // Grant access to the feature
        console.log("Customer has access to priority support");
    } else {
        // Show upgrade prompt
        console.log("Upgrade required for priority support");
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Get Detailed Entitlement Info

Use `getEntitlement` to get full details about a specific entitlement:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from kelviq_sdk import Kelviq

    client = Kelviq.create_sync_client(access_token="your_server_api_key")

    # Get detailed entitlement for a feature
    response = client.entitlements.get_entitlement(
        customerId="unique-customer-001",
        featureId="max-projects"
    )

    for entitlement in response.entitlements:
        print(f"Feature: {entitlement.featureId}")
        print(f"Has Access: {entitlement.hasAccess}")
        print(f"Type: {entitlement.featureType}")
        if entitlement.usageLimit:
            print(f"Limit: {entitlement.usageLimit}")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { Kelviq } from '@kelviq/node-sdk';

    const client = new Kelviq({ accessToken: 'your_server_api_key' });

    // Get detailed entitlement for a feature
    const response = await client.entitlements.getEntitlement({
        customerId: "unique-customer-001",
        featureId: "max-projects"
    });

    response.entitlements.forEach(entitlement => {
        console.log(`Feature: ${entitlement.featureId}`);
        console.log(`Has Access: ${entitlement.hasAccess}`);
        console.log(`Type: ${entitlement.featureType}`);
        if (entitlement.usageLimit) {
            console.log(`Limit: ${entitlement.usageLimit}`);
        }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Get All Entitlements for a Customer

Use `getAllEntitlements` to retrieve all entitlements for a customer:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from kelviq_sdk import Kelviq

    client = Kelviq.create_sync_client(access_token="your_server_api_key")

    # Get all entitlements for a customer
    response = client.entitlements.get_all_entitlements(
        customerId="unique-customer-001"
    )

    print(f"Customer: {response.customerId}")
    for entitlement in response.entitlements:
        print(f"- {entitlement.featureId}: {'Yes' if entitlement.hasAccess else 'No'}")
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```typescript
    import { Kelviq } from '@kelviq/node-sdk';

    const client = new Kelviq({ accessToken: 'your_server_api_key' });

    // Get all entitlements for a customer
    const response = await client.entitlements.getAllEntitlements({
        customerId: "unique-customer-001"
    });

    console.log(`Customer: ${response.customerId}`);
    response.entitlements.forEach(entitlement => {
        console.log(`- ${entitlement.featureId}: ${entitlement.hasAccess ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`);
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Entitlement Response Structure

When you retrieve entitlements, each entitlement includes:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `featureId` | string | The feature identifier |
| `featureType` | string | Type of feature (e.g., "BOOLEAN", "CUSTOMIZABLE") |
| `hasAccess` | boolean | Whether the customer has access |
| `usageLimit` | number | The limit value (for customizable features) |
| `currentUsage` | number | Current usage count (if applicable) |
| `remaining` | number | Remaining usage (if applicable) |

## Monitoring Entitlements

### Dashboard View

View customer entitlements in the dashboard:

1. **Go to Customers** → Select a customer
2. **Entitlements tab** → See all features and current status
3. **Override status** → See if any entitlements have been customized

## Entitlement Changes

When a customer's subscription changes, their entitlements automatically update:

### Plan Upgrade
```
Old Plan: Basic (5 projects)
New Plan: Pro (20 projects)
Result: Entitlement limit changes to 20 immediately
```

### Plan Downgrade
```
Old Plan: Pro (20 projects)
New Plan: Basic (5 projects)
Result: Entitlement limit changes to 5
```

### Subscription Cancellation
```
Status: Cancelled
Result: All entitlements become inactive
Effect: Customer cannot use any features
```

## Best Practices

### Entitlement Checks

- **Check early** - Verify entitlements before allowing access to features
- **Cache wisely** - Cache entitlement checks for performance, but refresh periodically
- **Graceful handling** - Handle "no access" gracefully with upgrade prompts

### Feature Design

- **Clear naming** - Use descriptive feature identifiers (e.g., "max-team-members" not "limit1")
- **Logical grouping** - Group related features in the same plan tier
- **Scalable limits** - Make limits increase with plan tiers

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="What happens when a customer's plan expires?">
  When a subscription is cancelled or expires, all entitlements become inactive. The customer cannot use any features. You should check entitlement status in your app before granting access.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I give a customer extra access without changing their plan?">
  Yes, you can customize entitlements for individual customers from the dashboard. This is useful for trials, promotions, or special agreements.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are entitlement checks real-time?">
  Yes, entitlement checks return the current state. When plans are changed or overrides are applied, subsequent checks reflect the new state immediately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle customers without a subscription?">
  Customers without an active subscription will have `hasAccess: false` for all features. Your app should handle this by showing appropriate messaging or free tier functionality.
</Accordion>
