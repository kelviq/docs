You can manage all your coupons from the **Product Catalog**.

Navigate to **Product Catalog > Discounts** to see a list of every active and expired code. You can create two types of discounts:
* **Percentage:** A relative cut (e.g. 20% off).
* **Fixed amount:** A specific dollar value (e.g. $10 off).

## Configuration options

You can control exactly how and when a discount applies.

### Duration
For recurring subscriptions, you define how long the discount lasts.
* **Once:** Applies only to the first invoice.
* **Forever:** Applies to every invoice indefinitely.
* **Repeating:** Applies for a specific number of billing cycles (e.g. "3 months off").

### Usage & expiry
Control the scarcity of the coupon.
* **Redemption limit:** Set a total number of times this code can be used (e.g. "First 100 users").
* **Expiry date:** Set a hard deadline when the code stops working.

### Product restrictions
By default, a discount applies to your entire catalog. You can restrict it to specific items.

1. Toggle **Limit discount on selected products**.
2. Select the products you want to include.
3. **Refine scope:** You can go even deeper by selecting specific price points.
   * *Example:* Apply the discount only to the "Pro Plan - Yearly" interval, while excluding the "Monthly" version.

## Management

The main discounts tab shows the status of every code you have created.
