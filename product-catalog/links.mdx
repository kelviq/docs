Links allow you to share important URLs with customers after they purchase your plan. Use links to grant access to communities, resources, or any web-based content.

## Overview

Use Links to share:
- **Community access** – Discord servers, Slack workspaces, or private forums
- **Knowledge bases** – Notion pages, documentation sites, or wikis
- **Membership portals** – Member-only websites or dashboards
- **Resource libraries** – Google Drive folders, Dropbox links, or online courses
- **Any other web content** your customers need access to
