## Refunds

When you issue a refund to a customer, the original transaction fee is **retained**. This applies to both full and partial refunds.

|----------|--------------|
| Full refund | Customer receives full amount; original fee retained |
| Partial refund | Customer receives partial amount; proportional fee retained |

<Warning>
Our payment partners charge non-refundable processing fees on the original transaction. We pass this cost structure through to maintain transparent pricing.
</Warning>

When a customer disputes a charge with their bank, a **$15 fee** applies regardless of the dispute outcome.

| Outcome | Fee | Transaction amount |
|---------|-----|-------------------|
| You win | $15 | Returned to you |
| You lose | $15 | Refunded to customer |
