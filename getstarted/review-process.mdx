title: 'Review Process'
---

Because Kelviq operates as your **Merchant of Record (MOR)**, we are legally and financially responsible for every transaction processed through our platform. To ensure the safety of the ecosystem and comply with global financial regulations, we must strictly review the businesses we support.

This guide outlines what we support, what we prohibit, and how our review process works.

## 1. Supported Business Models

Kelviq is optimized for **digital products and software**. We are the best fit for:

* **SaaS & Software:** B2B or B2C web applications, desktop software, AI tools, and browser extensions.
* **Digital Downloads:** E-books, PDFs, design templates, audio files, video courses, and fonts.
* **Membership Sites:** Newsletters, research communities, and gated content.
* **Professional Services:** *Only if sold alongside a software product (e.g., "Setup Fee" or "Priority Support").*

> **The Golden Rule:**
> Your product should be **digital**, **owned by you** (or properly licensed), and **deliverable immediately** upon purchase.

### ⛔ The Three Fundamental Limitations

Before proceeding, please note the three "Hard No" rules of our MOR service:

1.  **Digital Only:** We cannot support physical goods, shipping, or logistics.
2.  **No Manual Services:** We cannot support 1-on-1 coaching, consulting, or agencies where the primary value is your manual labor.
3.  **No Marketplaces:** You must be the original creator or licensed distributor. You cannot use Kelviq to process payments for other unverified sellers.

## 2. Global Compliance & High-Risk Categories (Prohibited)

We are required by law and our financial partners to block any product or service that is illegal, deceptive, or creates a high financial risk.

This list is not exhaustive, and we reserve the right to review, suspend, or terminate any account that we believe violates the spirit of these rules.

### A. Illegal, Deceptive, or Hateful Content
* Any product or service that is illegal in the U.S. or your customer's location.
* Content that infringes on someone else's Intellectual Property (IP), copyright, or trademark. (e.g., pirated software, stolen ebooks, cracked license keys).
* Hate speech or content that promotes violence, self-harm, or discrimination against any group.
* Deceptive marketing practices, fake testimonials, or unrealistic "get rich quick" schemes.
* Low-value, exploitative content (e.g., rapidly AI-generated ebooks with minimal substance sold at a high price).
* Identity services, fake IDs, or products that support academic cheating.

### B. Financial and Legal Services
* **Regulated Financial Products:** We cannot sell investment advice, trading signals, cryptocurrency, NFTs, lending services, or act as a money transmitter.
* **Gambling:** All forms of gambling, betting, or games of chance.
* **Regulated Professional Services:** We cannot sell legal, tax, or accounting advice.
* **Donations:** We cannot process donations where no specific product is delivered.
* **Regulatory Evasion:** Any service designed to help others evade taxes, mask their identity, or bypass financial regulations.

### C. Adult & Regulated Industries
* **Adult Content:** Explicitly sexual content (videos, images, text), whether real or **AI-generated**. This includes "AI Girlfriend/Boyfriend" services, NSFW chatbots, and services related to OnlyFans.
* **Controlled Substances:** Alcohol, tobacco, vaping products, drugs, or drug paraphernalia.
* **Weapons:** Firearms, ammunition, explosives, or combat training.
* **Pharmaceuticals:** Prescription drugs or unverified medical/wellness supplements.

### D. Platform & Technology Abuse
* **Spam & Scraping:** Tools for mass cold emailing, lead scraping, or sending bulk SMS/WhatsApp messages.
* **Hacking & Cheating:** Tools designed to cheat in games, bypass software rules, or gain unauthorized access.
* **Circumvention Tools:** Services that bypass API limits, platform rules, or geo-restrictions (e.g., IP cloaking).
* **Surveillance Tech:** Products that violate user privacy or enable unauthorized surveillance (e.g., keyloggers, stalkerware).

## 3. Restricted Businesses (Requires Extensive Review)

The following businesses are not automatically prohibited, but they are considered high-risk and require extensive review by our compliance team. Approval is not guaranteed and may be subject to additional conditions (like holding funds in reserve).

* **AI-Powered Services:** Especially tools for AI-generated text, images, or voice. We need to review your product to ensure it has proper safeguards against generating harmful, deceptive, or adult content.
* **Marketing Services:** Some marketing tools may be allowed, but we must review them to ensure they do not facilitate spam or mass outreach.
* **Pre-Orders & Paid Waitlists:** We generally **do not** allow pre-orders. This is a very high-risk category for an MOR. In rare cases, we may make an exception for established creators, but funds will be withheld until the product is verifiably shipped.

## 4. Prohibited & Supported Countries

### Prohibited Countries
As a U.S. company, Kelviq is required to comply with U.S. sanctions laws (OFAC). We are **strictly prohibited** from doing business with any individual or entity located in:

* North Korea
* Iran
* Cuba
* Syria
* Russia
* Belarus
* The regions of Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk

### Supported Payout Countries
We support businesses registered in **90+ countries**. You can receive payouts in your local bank account in currencies including USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, INR, and more.

## 5. The Review Process

Before you can process real payments, your account must pass our verification process. You can integrate and test in "Sandbox Mode" immediately, but "Live Mode" requires approval.

There are two steps to complete before you can start accepting real payments:

### Step 1: Business Verification

You'll see a **Business Verification** prompt in the sidebar of your dashboard. Click **Start verification** to begin.

</Frame>

Fill in your business details and click **Submit for review** when you're done.

</Frame>

**What happens next:**
- Most reviews are completed within **12-24 hours**.
- If we need more information, we'll reach out to you via email.
- Once your verification is approved, you'll receive a confirmation email.

### Step 2: Set Up Payouts

After your business is verified, you need to set up payouts to receive money from your sales. We partner with **Stripe** to enable secure payouts.

Navigate to the **Payouts** section in your dashboard, or go directly to [app.kelviq.com/payout](https://app.kelviq.com/payout).

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/review-process/payouts-setup.png" alt="Payouts setup page" />
</Frame>

Click the **Set up payouts** button. You'll be redirected to Stripe to complete a quick setup:

1. **Verify your identity** - Stripe will ask for a few details to verify your identity and business.
2. **Connect your bank account** - Add your bank account details to receive payouts.

Once you complete the Stripe setup, you'll be redirected back to Kelviq.

### You're Ready to Go Live

Once both steps are completed (Business Verification and Payout Setup), you can start accepting real payments from customers.

## 6. Testing Payments

<Warning>
Do not use your own real card to test payment flows.
</Warning>

For testing, you have two options:

1. **Use Sandbox Mode** - Switch to sandbox mode in your dashboard to test the entire checkout flow with test card numbers.
2. **Use 100% Discount Coupons** - Create a discount coupon with 100% off to test the checkout workflow in live mode without being charged.

## 7. Enforcement & Monitoring

Once you are live, we continuously monitor account activity to prevent fraud and ensure ongoing compliance.

* **Refund Rate Monitoring:** If your refund rate exceeds acceptable thresholds (typically >10%), we may reach out to help you improve your product quality or support.
* **Chargeback Monitoring:** We maintain a strict low-tolerance policy for chargebacks. Excessive dispute levels may result in account review.
* **Prohibited Activity:** If an account is found to be selling prohibited items or engaging in money laundering/fraud after approval, the account will be suspended immediately and funds may be held to cover potential disputes.

## 8. Have a Question About Your Product?

We know this list is long, and the line can be blurry, especially with new AI tools. We want to support innovative products.

If you are unsure if your product is allowed, **please contact us at hi@kelviq.com *before* you launch.**

Our simple "gut check" is: **Is this a high-quality, legitimate product that you are proud of, that you own the rights to, and that is delivered digitally?** If you can answer "yes" to all three, you are probably in the clear.
