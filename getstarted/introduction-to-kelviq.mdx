## Why Kelviq

Monetization is more than just a payment. It's a complex system of pricing models, usage metering, subscription logic, feature access, global tax, and compliance. Building this from scratch takes months of engineering time and ongoing legal overhead.

Kelviq is the complete revenue system that handles all this complexity for you. You can launch any pricing model and sell globally from day one, all while staying compliant.

With Kelviq you can:

- **Handle Global Tax & Compliance Automatically** As your Merchant of Record, Kelviq takes on the full liability for global sales tax (VAT, GST, etc.), fraud, and regulatory compliance. You can sell in 100+ countries without ever registering for a foreign tax ID.

- **Get started in minutes** You don’t have to handle dozens of webhooks, build a database layer to track customers, manage subscription states, or hardcode feature access. Kelviq provides a single, unified system.

- **Run any pricing model** Flat fee, usage, seats, tiers, volume, credits, pay-as-you-go, overage charges, or hybrids. Configure them in minutes.

- **Sell digital products with ease** Securely deliver files, e-books, or software on purchase and automatically generate license keys to validate customers.

- **Meter usage in real time** Count every API hit, data storage unit, or AI tokens in real time. Set soft or hard caps, pick reset cycles, send alerts, and handle overages with one call.

- **Control feature access** Define features per plan. Turn them on or off and check access in your app with one SDK call.

- **Localized pricing by country** Offer country-specific prices in 135+ currencies with VPN, proxy, and fraud protection built in. You can also set up promotions for specific countries.

- **Ship pricing changes without touching code** A/B test plans, roll out changes, or update pricing in real time without redeploys.

- **Manage the full customer lifecycle** Handle upgrades, downgrades, migrations, overrides, and grandfathering without writing custom scripts.
