Managing customers sits at the center of Kelviq. Each customer connects directly to their subscriptions, the plans behind them, and the features they own. You need to understand these relationships to handle the full customer lifecycle.

## View customer list

Select **Customers** in the main navigation to see your list.

You can do a few things here.
* **Search** by name, email, or identifier.
* **Add a new customer** with the button in the top right.
* **Manage a customer** by clicking their row to see details.

## Add a new customer

You can create records manually.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the modal">
    Click **+ New customer** in the top right of the list page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in details">
    You need to provide a few key pieces of info.
    * **Customer name** is required. Use the person's full name or company name.
    * **Identifier** is the unique ID the API uses. We auto-generate this based on the name, but you can edit it. Linking this to the ID in your own database is usually a good idea.
    * **Email address** is optional.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **Create** to finish.
    
    If you are adding a batch of people, toggle on **Create more**. This keeps the window open so you can add the next one immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Entitlements

This view shows exactly what the customer can do right now based on their plan.

You often need to make exceptions for specific users. You can do that here without changing the underlying plan.
* Change the value of a specific feature.
* Update the usage limit for a metered feature.

Changes made here apply only to this specific customer.
