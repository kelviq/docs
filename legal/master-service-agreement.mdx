## 3. Merchant of Record Relationship

### 3.1 Kelviq as Merchant of Record

For all transactions processed through Kelviq Checkout, Kelviq acts as the Merchant of Record. This means that Kelviq is the legal seller to the Buyer for the purpose of payment processing, receipts, invoices, refunds, disputes, chargebacks, and applicable tax collection and remittance.

Kelviq's name and branding will appear on Buyer bank and card statements, checkout pages, receipts, and invoices. The Statement Descriptor for transactions will identify Kelviq as the merchant.

### 3.2 What the MoR Relationship Means for Sellers

As the MoR, Kelviq takes on the following responsibilities on behalf of the Seller:

- Processing Buyer payments through Kelviq Checkout
- Issuing receipts and invoices to Buyers in Kelviq's name
- Handling payment disputes, chargebacks, and refund requests
- Collecting and remitting applicable sales tax, VAT, or GST where required
- Appearing as the merchant on Buyer bank and card statements
- Complying with payment network rules (Visa, Mastercard, and other applicable networks) for transactions processed through the Platform

<Note>
The Seller remains responsible for the Product itself, including product quality, content accuracy, customer support for product-related issues, and fulfillment of any promises made to Buyers about the Product.
</Note>

### 3.3 Relationship to Buyers

When a Buyer purchases a Product through Kelviq Checkout, the Buyer's contractual relationship for the payment transaction is with Kelviq. The Buyer's relationship for the Product and its use is with the Seller, unless the Seller's checkout page or product listing explicitly states otherwise.

## 4. Seller Onboarding and Verification

### 4.1 Account Registration

To sell through Kelviq, you must complete the seller onboarding process, which includes providing accurate business information, verifying your identity, and accepting this Agreement.

### 4.2 Know Your Customer (KYC) and Identity Verification

Kelviq is required to verify the identity of all Sellers before enabling live payment processing. As part of onboarding, you must provide:

- Legal name of the business or individual
- Business registration details (where applicable)
- Business address and country of incorporation or residence
- Identity verification documents as requested by Kelviq or its payment partners
- Tax identification information where required by law

Kelviq reserves the right to request additional information or documentation at any time to maintain compliance with applicable Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), and sanctions regulations.

### 4.3 Stripe Connected Account

As part of the onboarding process, the Seller must create and maintain a Stripe Connected Account to receive Payouts. By completing this step, the Seller agrees to be bound by the Stripe Connected Account Agreement (available at stripe.com/legal/connect-account) as it may be updated from time to time.

The Seller acknowledges that Kelviq is not a party to the Stripe Connected Account Agreement and that Stripe may independently impose requirements, restrictions, or limitations on the Seller's Connected Account.

### 4.4 Business Review

Before enabling live payment processing, Kelviq will review the Seller's business, products, and intended use of the Platform. Kelviq may approve, conditionally approve, or reject a Seller application at its sole discretion. Approval criteria are described in the Kelviq Approved and Prohibited Business Policy.

Kelviq may re-review a Seller's account at any time and may suspend or terminate access if the Seller no longer meets approval criteria.

### 4.5 Ongoing Compliance

The Seller must promptly notify Kelviq of any material changes to their business, including changes to the types of Products sold, business structure, ownership, country of operation, or any event that could affect the Seller's eligibility under this Agreement or the Approved and Prohibited Business Policy.

## 5. Seller Obligations

- Providing accurate and non-misleading product descriptions, pricing, and marketing materials
- Delivering digital Products to Buyers promptly after purchase (through Kelviq's delivery mechanisms or the Seller's own fulfillment process)

### 5.2 Legal Compliance

Failure to cooperate may result in the dispute being resolved against the Seller.

### 5.4 Accurate Information

The Seller must keep all account information, business details, and product listings current and accurate. The Seller must not provide false, misleading, or incomplete information to Kelviq, Buyers, or any third party in connection with the Platform.

## 6. Fees

### 6.1 Platform Fees

Kelviq charges Platform Fees for use of the Platform services, including payment processing, checkout hosting, and MoR services. The current fee schedule is displayed in the Seller Dashboard and on the Kelviq website ([kelviq.com/pricing](https://kelviq.com/pricing)).

Kelviq may update the fee schedule with at least 30 days' prior written notice to the Seller. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a fee change constitutes acceptance of the updated fees.

### 6.2 Payment Processing Fees

Payment processing fees are included in the Platform Fee. The Seller is not charged separate payment processing fees by Kelviq. All fees are displayed in the Seller Dashboard and deducted from the gross transaction amount before the Seller's Net Revenue is calculated.

### 6.3 Fee Deduction

All fees (Platform Fees and payment processing fees) are deducted automatically from the gross transaction amount before Payouts are made to the Seller. The Seller can view a breakdown of all fees in the Seller Dashboard.

### 6.4 Taxes on Fees

Fees quoted by Kelviq are exclusive of any taxes on the fees themselves. If applicable taxes are required to be charged on Kelviq's fees, they will be added to the fee amount.

## 7. Payout Terms

### 7.1 Payout Schedule

Funds from completed transactions are added to the Seller's available balance after processing. Sellers can withdraw their available balance at any time through the Seller Dashboard.

Kelviq may impose a holding period for new Seller accounts during the first 30 days of activity, or for accounts that present elevated risk factors as determined by Kelviq's compliance team.

### 7.2 Payout Method

Payouts are made to the Seller's bank account through the Seller's Stripe Connected Account. The Seller is responsible for maintaining a valid, active bank account and keeping payout details up to date in the Stripe dashboard.

### 7.3 Payout Currency

Payouts are made in the currency associated with the Seller's bank account. Currency conversion, if applicable, is handled by Stripe and subject to Stripe's exchange rates and conversion fees.

### 7.4 Minimum Withdrawal Threshold

Kelviq may set a minimum withdrawal threshold. The current minimum threshold is displayed in the Seller Dashboard.

## 8. Reserves and Holdbacks

### 8.1 Reserve Rights

Kelviq reserves the right to require a reserve on the Seller's account if Kelviq reasonably determines that the Seller's account presents an elevated financial risk. Risk factors that may trigger a reserve include, but are not limited to:

- High chargeback or dispute rates (typically exceeding 1% of transactions)
- High refund rates (typically exceeding 10% of transactions)
- Sale of products in restricted categories (as defined in the Approved and Prohibited Business Policy)
- Pre-order or delayed delivery products
- Sudden or unexplained spikes in transaction volume
- Negative media coverage or consumer complaints about the Seller's products

### 8.2 Reserve Amounts and Duration

If a reserve is imposed, Kelviq will notify the Seller in writing of the reserve percentage or fixed amount and the expected duration. Reserves may be implemented as a percentage of each transaction (rolling reserve) or as a fixed amount withheld from the Seller's balance. Kelviq will review reserves periodically and release them when the risk conditions that triggered the reserve have been resolved.

### 8.3 Post-Termination Reserve

Upon termination of this Agreement, Kelviq may hold a reserve for up to **180 days** to cover potential chargebacks, refunds, or other liabilities arising from transactions processed during the term of the Agreement.

## 9. Disputes, Chargebacks, and Refunds

### 9.1 Chargeback and Dispute Handling

As the Merchant of Record, Kelviq manages the chargeback and dispute process with payment networks and issuing banks. When a Chargeback is received:

1. Kelviq will notify the Seller and request relevant information and evidence to respond to the dispute
2. The Seller must provide the requested information within the due date mentioned in the notification
3. Kelviq will submit the dispute response to the payment network on behalf of the Seller
4. If the dispute is resolved in favor of the Buyer, the Chargeback amount (plus any applicable fees) will be deducted from the Seller's balance or future Payouts

### 9.2 Chargeback Liability

The Seller is financially responsible for all Chargebacks related to their Products. This includes the original transaction amount and a **$15 dispute fee** per chargeback. Additional fees imposed by payment networks or processors may also apply.

<Warning>
If the Seller's chargeback rate exceeds the thresholds set by payment networks (typically 0.75%-1.0% of transactions), Kelviq may impose additional restrictions, require a reserve, or terminate this Agreement.
</Warning>

### 9.3 Refund Policy

Kelviq manages refund requests from Buyers. The applicable refund policy is displayed to Buyers at checkout and in the Kelviq customer portal. Refunds may be issued:

- At the Seller's direction through the Seller Dashboard
- By Kelviq in accordance with the refund policy displayed at checkout
- By Kelviq where required by applicable consumer protection law
- By Kelviq to resolve disputes or prevent chargebacks

Refund amounts are deducted from the Seller's balance or future Payouts. Payment processing fees may or may not be refunded depending on the payment method and processor terms.

### 9.4 Excessive Refunds

If the Seller's refund rate exceeds 10% of transactions over any rolling 30-day period, Kelviq may review the Seller's account and take action including requiring product changes, imposing payout holds, or terminating this Agreement.
