<Info>
**Effective Date:** December 23, 2025
</Info>

These Buyer Terms are a contract between you and Kelviq, Inc. ("Kelviq", "we", "us"). By using Kelviq checkout or the customer portal, you agree to these terms.

## 1. Who We Are

<Card>
**Kelviq, Inc.**

2261 Market Street STE 46163
San Francisco, CA 94114

Email: [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com)
</Card>

Kelviq acts as the Merchant of Record for all purchases made through Kelviq checkout. This means your payment is made to Kelviq, and Kelviq issues your receipt or invoice, handles refunds (when approved), and manages disputes and chargebacks. Kelviq's name will appear on your bank or card statement as the merchant for the transaction.

## 2. Who These Terms Cover

These terms apply to buyers who use:

- Kelviq checkout and payment pages
- The Kelviq customer portal (orders, invoices, downloads, license keys, subscriptions, refunds)

## 3. Eligibility

You must be 18 or older to buy through Kelviq. By placing an order, you confirm you are an adult and you have the right to use the payment method.

## 4. Your Order

When you place an order, you agree that:

- The information you provide is accurate (name, email, billing details).
- You are allowed to buy and use the product under your local laws.
- We may decline, cancel, or limit an order if we believe it is suspicious, fraudulent, or not allowed.

## 5. Prices, Currency, and Taxes

- Prices and currency are shown at checkout before you pay.
- If taxes are required (based on location and rules), they will be shown at checkout or included in the total, depending on the product and region.
- If you use discounts, they apply only as shown at checkout.

## 6. Payments

- Kelviq uses Stripe to process payments.
- Kelviq does not store full card numbers on our servers.
- Your bank or payment provider may charge extra fees (example: foreign transaction fees). Those fees are not controlled by Kelviq.

## 7. Statement Descriptor

When you make a purchase through Kelviq, your bank or card statement will show "KELVIQ" (or "KELVIQ*" followed by a product identifier) as the merchant name. This is because Kelviq is the Merchant of Record for the transaction.

## 8. Digital Delivery and Access

Kelviq delivers digital goods through the customer portal, such as:

- Download links or access links
- License keys
- Order and invoice history

Access and downloads may require you to verify your email using an OTP code.

<Note>
**Important:** The product itself is created and maintained by the seller. Kelviq handles payment and delivery links, but the seller controls product content, updates, and product support (unless the checkout page says Kelviq provides that support).
</Note>

## 9. License Keys and Usage Rules

If your purchase includes a license key or similar access token:

- You must keep it secure and not share it unless the product terms allow sharing.
- We may disable a key if we believe it was shared, resold, or misused, or if a payment is reversed (chargeback, reversal, or unpaid invoice).

## 10. Subscriptions

If you buy a subscription:

- Your subscription renews automatically until you cancel.
- Renewal timing and price are shown at checkout or in your portal.
- You can cancel from the customer portal. Cancellation typically takes effect at the end of the current billing period unless stated otherwise at checkout.
- If a renewal payment fails, we will retry the charge. For card payments, access will remain available for up to 2 weeks before the subscription is canceled. For other payment methods, the subscription will be canceled immediately if payment fails.

## 11. Refunds

Unless a different refund policy is displayed at checkout, the default refund window for digital products purchased through Kelviq is **30 days** from the date of purchase. Refunds may also be subject to any additional rules that apply in your country.

**How refunds work:**

- You can request a refund in the customer portal or by emailing [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com).
- If a refund is approved, it is sent back to the original payment method when possible.
- Some fees may not be refundable if your payment provider keeps them (this varies by method and country).
- We may refuse refund requests that appear abusive, fraudulent, or not allowed by the refund terms or local law.
- For subscription products, refunds apply to the most recent billing period only, unless otherwise required by law.

## 12. Disputes and Chargebacks

If you file a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank:

- We may suspend or remove access to the product while the dispute is open.
- We may ask for details to investigate (example: proof of purchase, order details).
- If the dispute is decided against you, you may lose access and may not be eligible for a refund through Kelviq.

<Tip>
If you have a problem, contact [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com) first. It is usually faster than a bank dispute.
</Tip>

## 13. Fraud Prevention and Order Blocking

We use risk checks to prevent fraud and abuse. This can include automatic decisions that:

- Block a payment
- Require extra verification
- Limit certain transactions

If your payment is blocked by mistake, contact [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com) and we will review.

## 14. Prohibited Activity

You may not use Kelviq checkout or the customer portal to:

- Break laws or payment network rules
- Attempt fraud, chargeback abuse, or evasion of security checks
- Access digital goods you did not purchase
- Reverse engineer, scrape, or attack our systems
- Use stolen payment methods or unauthorized accounts

<Warning>
We may suspend access or cancel orders if we believe prohibited activity occurred.
</Warning>

## 15. Third Party Products and Seller Responsibility

Products sold through Kelviq come from independent sellers. Unless the checkout page clearly says otherwise:

- The seller is responsible for product content, accuracy, and support.
- Kelviq is not the maker of the product.

If you need product help (bugs, usage, features), the seller is usually the right contact. If you are not sure how to reach them, email [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com) and we will help route it.

## 16. Service Changes

We may change checkout, portal features, or delivery methods to improve reliability or comply with laws. We may also update these terms. If changes are important, we will update the effective date and may provide notice in the portal or at checkout.

## 17. Warranty Disclaimer

To the fullest extent allowed by law:

- Kelviq provides checkout and portal access "as is" and "as available".
- We do not promise uninterrupted service or that every transaction will succeed.
- We do not make promises about the seller's product quality or fitness for your needs.

<Note>
Some places do not allow certain disclaimers, so some of the above may not apply to you.
</Note>

## 18. Limits of Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law:

- Kelviq is not liable for indirect losses (lost profits, lost data, or business interruption).
- Kelviq's total liability for a claim related to a specific purchase is limited to the amount you paid to Kelviq for that purchase.

<Note>
Some places do not allow certain limits, so some of the above may not apply to you.
</Note>

## 19. Termination and Access Removal

We may suspend or end your access to the portal or digital goods if:

- A payment is reversed or not paid.
- You violate these terms.
- We must do so to comply with law or protect users.

You can stop using Kelviq at any time. If you have an account or portal access, you can request help via [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com).

## 20. Governing Law and Venue

These terms are governed by the laws of California, excluding conflict of law rules. Any dispute must be brought in state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California, unless local law requires another venue.
