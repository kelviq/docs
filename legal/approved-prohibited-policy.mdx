## 1. Purpose

As the MoR, Kelviq is legally and financially responsible for every transaction processed through the platform. This policy defines the types of businesses, products, and activities that are approved, restricted, or prohibited on the Kelviq platform.

This policy is designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, payment network rules (including Visa and Mastercard operating regulations), U.S. sanctions laws (OFAC), and the terms of our payment processing agreements with Stripe, Inc.

## 5. Restricted Business Categories

The following categories are not automatically prohibited but are considered high-risk. Accounts in these categories require additional review by the Kelviq compliance team. Approval is not guaranteed and may be subject to conditions such as reserve requirements, payout holds, or additional monitoring.

### 5.1 AI-Powered Products and Services

AI tools that generate text, images, voice, video, or other content require review to verify:

- The product has appropriate safeguards against generating harmful, deceptive, adult, or illegal content
- The product does not facilitate deepfakes, impersonation, or disinformation
- The product's marketing accurately represents its capabilities
- The Seller has content moderation policies in place

### 5.2 Marketing and Outreach Tools

Some marketing tools may be approved, but the following require additional review:

- Social media automation tools (must comply with platform terms of service)
- Lead generation tools (must not facilitate scraping or unauthorized data collection)

### 5.3 Pre-orders and Paid Waitlists

Pre-orders are generally not approved due to the high chargeback risk for an MoR. In rare cases, exceptions may be made for established creators with a proven track record. If approved, funds will be held in reserve until the product is verifiably delivered.

### 5.4 High-Value Digital Products

Products priced above $500 per transaction may require additional review due to elevated chargeback risk.
