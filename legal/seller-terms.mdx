**Effective Date:** December 23, 2025
</Info>

These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") are a contract between you and Kelviq, Inc. ("Kelviq", "we", "us"). By accessing or using our website, app, dashboard, checkout, APIs, or customer portal (together, the "Services"), you agree to these Terms.

## 1. Company Details and Contact

<Card>
**Kelviq, Inc.**

2261 Market Street STE 46163
San Francisco, CA 94114

Email: [support@kelviq.com](mailto:support@kelviq.com)
</Card>

## 2. Who These Terms Apply To

These Terms apply to:

- Website visitors
- Users of the Kelviq app and dashboard (including sellers and team members)
- Buyers using checkout and the customer portal

<Note>
If you are buying through checkout, your purchase is also governed by the Kelviq Buyer Terms. If you are a seller, your use of the platform to sell products is also governed by the Kelviq Seller Master Service Agreement. If there is a conflict between these Terms and the applicable specific agreement, the specific agreement controls.
</Note>

## 3. Eligibility

You must be 18 or older to use the Services. If you use the Services on behalf of a company, you confirm you have authority to bind that company to these Terms.

## 4. Accounts and Access

- You are responsible for your account and any activity under it.
- Keep your login details and OTP codes secure.
- Tell us if you suspect unauthorized access.
- We can suspend or disable accounts to protect the Services, comply with law, or stop abuse.

## 5. The Services

Kelviq provides tools to help sellers sell digital goods, and to help buyers complete purchases and manage orders.

Kelviq may add, remove, or change features. We will try to avoid breaking changes, but we do not guarantee any specific feature will remain available.

## 6. Merchant of Record and Payments

For all purchases processed through Kelviq checkout, Kelviq acts as the **Merchant of Record**. This means Kelviq is the party shown as the seller on the Buyer's bank or card statement, receipts, invoices, and is responsible for payment processing, refunds, disputes, and applicable tax collection and remittance.

We use Stripe to process payments. We do not store full card numbers on our servers.

The Buyer's bank or card statement will display "KELVIQ" (or "KELVIQ*" followed by a product identifier) as the merchant name for the transaction.

## 7. Fees

Some parts of the Services may require fees (for example, platform fees or processing fees). Fees, if any, will be shown in the dashboard, checkout flow, an order summary, or an agreement you accept during onboarding.

Unless required by law, fees are non-refundable.

## 8. Seller Responsibilities

If you sell through Kelviq ("Seller"), you agree to the following. For a complete description of the Seller's obligations, refer to the Kelviq Seller Master Service Agreement.

### 8.1 Your Products and Content

- You are responsible for your products, files, license terms, claims, and support promises.
- You will not sell illegal or prohibited items, or content that violates laws or third-party rights.
- You will keep your product description accurate and not misleading.

### 8.2 Customer Support

Unless the checkout page clearly says otherwise, you are responsible for product support, including bugs, feature questions, and usage issues. Kelviq may help route messages, but we are not required to provide product support.

### 8.3 Compliance

You agree to follow all applicable laws and payment network rules, including rules about prohibited products, sanctions, and consumer protection.

### 8.4 Stripe Connected Account

As part of using the platform as a Seller, you must create a Stripe Connected Account and accept the Stripe Connected Account Agreement. You acknowledge that Stripe may independently impose requirements on your Connected Account.

### 8.5 Disputes and Refunds

We may handle payment disputes and chargebacks as part of operating the checkout. We may ask you for information to respond to disputes. You agree to cooperate promptly.

## 9. Acceptable Use

<Warning>
You may not:
</Warning>

- Use the Services for illegal activity
- Attempt fraud, chargeback abuse, or evasion of security checks
- Upload malware or attempt to disrupt the Services
- Scrape, crawl, or reverse engineer the Services except where the law allows it
- Access or download content you did not purchase or do not have rights to
- Impersonate others or misrepresent your identity

We may remove content, block transactions, or suspend accounts to enforce these rules.

## 10. Content, Uploads, and Feedback

You keep ownership of content you upload (product files, text, branding). You grant Kelviq a limited license to host, process, and display that content only to operate the Services.

If you share feedback or suggestions, you allow Kelviq to use them without restriction or payment.

## 11. Intellectual Property

Kelviq owns the Services, including software, design, branding, and related materials. You may not copy, modify, or distribute Kelviq materials unless allowed by law or with our written permission.

## 12. Privacy

Our Privacy Policy explains how we handle personal information. By using the Services, you agree to our Privacy Policy. Stripe processes Seller and transaction data as described in Stripe's Privacy Policy.

## 13. Third Party Services

The Services may rely on third party tools (payments, hosting, email, fraud prevention). Those providers may have their own terms. Kelviq is not responsible for third party services we do not control.

## 14. Suspension and Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Services if:

- You violate these Terms
- We believe your activity creates risk, fraud, or harm
- We must do so to comply with law
- Your payments fail or are reversed (for buyer access or seller payouts)

You may stop using the Services at any time.

## 15. Disclaimers

To the fullest extent allowed by law, the Services are provided "as is" and "as available". We do not promise uninterrupted service, error-free operation, or that every payment will succeed.

Sellers are responsible for their products. Kelviq does not promise product quality, fitness, or outcomes from seller products.

<Note>
Some regions do not allow certain disclaimers, so parts of this section may not apply to you.
</Note>

## 16. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law:

- Kelviq is not liable for indirect losses (lost profits, lost revenue, lost data, or business interruption).
- Kelviq's total liability for claims related to the Services is limited to the amount paid to Kelviq for the Services in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim.
- For claims tied to a specific buyer purchase, our total liability is limited to the amount paid for that purchase.

<Note>
Some regions do not allow certain limits, so parts of this section may not apply to you.
</Note>

## 17. Indemnity

If you are a **Seller**, you agree to defend and indemnify Kelviq from claims arising from your products or content, your promises to buyers, and your violation of law or third-party rights.

If you are a **Buyer**, you agree to indemnify Kelviq for claims arising from your misuse of the Services or violation of these Terms.

## 18. Governing Law and Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of California, excluding conflict of laws rules. Any dispute must be brought in state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California, unless local law requires another venue.

## 19. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms. If changes are material, we will update the effective date and may provide notice through the website, app, dashboard, checkout, or portal. Continued use after the change means you accept the updated Terms.

## 20. Miscellaneous

- If a part of these Terms is unenforceable, the rest still applies.
- You may not transfer your rights under these Terms without our permission. We may assign these Terms as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets.
- These Terms are the full agreement about the Services, except where you have a separate written agreement with Kelviq (such as the Seller Master Service Agreement).
