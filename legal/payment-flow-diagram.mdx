## 1. Payment Architecture Overview

Kelviq uses Stripe Connect with **separate charges and transfers** as its payment integration model. Under this model:

- **Kelviq is the Merchant of Record (MoR)** for all transactions. The payment charge is created on Kelviq's platform Stripe account.
- After a successful charge, Kelviq initiates a **separate transfer** to the Seller's Stripe Connected Account for the Seller's share of the revenue (Net Revenue).
- Kelviq deducts Platform Fees and applicable taxes before transferring funds to the Seller.
- The Buyer sees "KELVIQ" (or a Kelviq-branded descriptor) on their bank or card statement.
- Kelviq is responsible for refunds, disputes, and chargebacks as the settlement merchant.

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### 6.1 Stripe Connect Configuration

| Configuration | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Account type | Stripe Connect with separate charges and transfers |
| Platform account | Kelviq, Inc. (standard Stripe account) |
| Connected accounts | Express accounts for Sellers (Stripe-hosted onboarding) |
| Charge creation | PaymentIntent created on Kelviq's platform account |
| Transfer | Separate Transfer object to Seller's Connected Account after successful charge |
| Statement descriptor | Set on the PaymentIntent, shows "KELVIQ" or a Kelviq-branded descriptor |
| Payout schedule | Manual withdrawals; Sellers can withdraw available balance anytime |

### 6.2 PCI Compliance

Kelviq uses **Stripe.js and Stripe Elements** on the checkout page. Card data is collected directly by Stripe and never passes through or is stored on Kelviq's servers. This keeps Kelviq at the lowest PCI compliance level (**SAQ-A**).

### 6.3 3D Secure and Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)

Kelviq supports **3D Secure (3DS)** authentication through Stripe for transactions where it is required by regulation or recommended for fraud prevention.

For Buyers in the **European Economic Area (EEA)** and the **United Kingdom**, Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is applied in accordance with the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) requirements. 3DS authentication is triggered automatically by Stripe based on the issuing bank's requirements and Stripe's risk assessment (Stripe Radar).

### 6.4 Tax Handling

Kelviq calculates and collects applicable **sales tax, VAT, or GST** at checkout based on the Buyer's location. Tax amounts are remitted to the appropriate tax authorities by Kelviq as the MoR. Tax is deducted from the gross transaction amount before the Seller's Net Revenue is calculated.

### 6.5 Multi-Currency Support

Kelviq supports checkout in **multiple currencies**. The Buyer pays in the currency displayed at checkout. Currency conversion for Seller payouts is handled by Stripe based on the Seller's Connected Account currency.
