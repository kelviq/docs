Checkout in Kelviq allows you to collect payments from customers. You can generate checkout links for your products, customize the checkout experience, and support multiple payment options and billing periods.

## Overview

Kelviq's checkout system:
- **Powers your sales** - Collect payments and create customer subscriptions
- **Integrates with Stripe** - Uses Stripe as the payment processor
- **Highly configurable** - Control plans, pricing, trial periods, and more
- **Multi-currency ready** - Support customers worldwide
- **Easy to embed** - Generate links for any product and plans

## Generating Checkout Links

Checkout links are generated at the **product level**. Each link can include one or more plans.

### Quick Start

1. **Go to Products** → Select your product
2. **Click "Generate Checkout Link"** → Opens the link builder
3. **Select plans** → Choose which plans to include
4. **Configure options** → Set defaults and features
5. **Copy link** → Share with customers

### Link Format

Generated checkout links follow this pattern:

```
https://checkout.kelviq.com/products/{PRODUCT_ID}
  ?enabled={PLAN_1_ID},{PLAN_2_ID}
  &plan_identifier={DEFAULT_PLAN_ID}
  &charge_period={DEFAULT_PERIOD}
```

Example:
```
https://checkout.kelviq.com/products/prod_abc123
  ?enabled=plan_basic,plan_pro
  &plan_identifier=plan_pro
  &charge_period=monthly
```

## Multi-Plan Checkout

Include multiple plans in a single checkout to let customers choose their tier.

### Configuration

<Card>
  **Plans Configuration**
  - Select which plans are enabled (shown to customer)
  - Choose a recommended plan (highlighted by default)
  - Cannot disable all plans
  - Disabled plans don't appear in checkout
</Card>

### Example: SaaS Pricing

Your product has 3 plans: Free, Pro, Enterprise

```
Plan 1: Free
├─ Enabled: Yes
├─ Price: $0/month
└─ Show in checkout: Yes

Plan 2: Pro (Recommended)
├─ Enabled: Yes
├─ Price: $29/month
└─ Show in checkout: Yes (selected by default)

Plan 3: Enterprise
├─ Enabled: Yes
├─ Price: Custom quote
└─ Show in checkout: Yes
```

Generated checkout URL:
```
?enabled=free,pro,enterprise&plan_identifier=pro
```

## Billing Periods & Pricing

### Supported Billing Periods

Plans in Kelviq can support multiple billing periods:

| Period | Duration | Use Case |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Monthly** | 1 month | Subscription SaaS, recurring billing |
| **Quarterly** | 3 months | Medium-term commitments |
| **Semi-annual** | 6 months | Longer commitments, volume discounts |
| **Yearly** | 12 months | Annual billing, biggest discounts |
| **One-time** | One-off payment | Digital products, courses, lifetime access |

### Setting Default Billing Period

Configure which billing period is pre-selected for each plan:

```
Plan: Pro
├─ Monthly: $29/month (default for checkout)
├─ Yearly: $290/year (saves $58)
└─ Checkout pre-selects: Monthly
```

In your checkout link:
```
&charge_period=monthly
```

### Pricing by Period

Different plans can have different pricing for the same period:

```
Plan: Basic
├─ Monthly: $9/month
└─ Yearly: $90/year

Plan: Pro
├─ Monthly: $29/month
└─ Yearly: $290/year (2.5% discount vs monthly)

Plan: Enterprise
├─ Monthly: $99/month
└─ Yearly: $999/year (16% discount vs monthly)
```

Customers see all options and can choose their preferred period at checkout.

## Free Trials

Offer free trial periods before charging customers.

### Configuring Trials

1. **Open your plan** → Go to the plan's pricing section
2. **Enable Free Trial** → Toggle the trial option
3. **Set duration** → 1-365 days (default 30)
4. **Save plan**

### Trial Behavior

When a customer starts a trial:

```
Timeline:
Day 0: Customer signs up, trial begins
Days 1-30: Customer has full access, no charge
Day 30: Trial ends, first billing occurs
Day 31+: Regular subscription
```

### Trial Configuration Example

```
Plan: Professional
├─ Regular price: $29/month
├─ Free trial: 30 days
├─ After trial: Full charge of $29
└─ Customer can cancel anytime during trial
```

<Tip>
  Trials reduce payment friction. Customers are more likely to convert from trial to paid if they've experienced value.
</Tip>

## Advanced Checkout Configuration

### Custom Return URL

After checkout succeeds, redirect customers to your custom URL:

```
Customer completes purchase
    ↓
Kelviq redirects to your success page
    ↓
You can:
- Show confirmation
- Deliver files/licenses
- Set up their account
- Continue onboarding
```

Configure in your checkout link via API or dashboard:
```
&return_url=https://yourdomain.com/checkout-success
```

### Discount Code Integration

Allow customers to apply discount codes at checkout:

```
Customer at checkout:
1. Select plan and period
2. (Optional) Enter discount code
3. See adjusted price
4. Complete payment
```

Discount codes are applied automatically if the customer enters a valid code.

### Tax Collection

Kelviq can collect and handle taxes:

**Tax ID Collection:**
- Customers can enter their tax ID (VAT number, EIN, etc.)
- Used to determine applicable taxes
- Required for some jurisdictions

**Configuration:**

├─ Available countries: US, UK, CA, AU

## Checkout Session Lifecycle

└─ Session expires after 24 hours

↓

OR

closed
├─ Customer abandoned checkout
├─ No payment processed
├─ Customer can restart
└─ Session expired
```

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="Can I have different checkout experiences for different customers?">
  Not directly in Kelviq, but you can generate different checkout links for different customer segments and use UTM parameters or custom return URLs to track them separately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens to a customer's data if they abandon checkout?">
  If they don't complete payment, a customer profile is not created. On next checkout, they'll be treated as a new customer. Email-based checkout sessions can bridge this gap.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I embed checkout in my website instead of linking to it?">
  Kelviq checkout is a hosted page. You link to it from your site. This ensures PCI compliance and security. You can customize the appearance via Stripe settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What payment methods can customers use?">
  Whatever Stripe supports in their region: Credit cards (universal), digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay), and local methods (ACH, SEPA, iDEAL, etc.).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I offer a 'pay what you want' option?">
  Not directly in Kelviq. Create a fixed-price plan instead, or use a separate system for custom pricing.
</Accordion>
