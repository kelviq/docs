title: 'Integrate with your app'
---

After setting up your product and plans in the dashboard, you can bring them into your app using the kelviq SDKs and UI components.

> Note: In this guide we use the **Node SDK** and **React SDK** as examples.  
> Other SDKs like Python, JavaScript, are also available — the steps are the same.

---

## 1. Create a customer (optional)

Typically, you create a customer record when someone signs up in your app.
When they complete a purchase, Kelviq maps the transaction to the customer record automatically.

This is optional, but creating a customer in kelviq makes it easy to track subscriptions and usage in the dashboard.

### Install the Node SDK

```bash
npm install @kelviq/node-sdk
````

```ts
import { kelviq } from "@kelviq/node-sdk";

// API keys are under Settings → Developers in the dashboard
const client = new kelviq({
  accessToken: process.env.Kelviq_SERVER_API_KEY!,
});

// Create a customer on signup
const newCustomer = await client.customers.create({
  customerId: "unique-customer-001",
  email: "customer@example.com",
  name: "Node SDK User",
});
```

## 2. Checkout links

Every plan in Kelviq has a checkout link that you can use to send customers directly to checkout.

### Get a checkout link

1. In the dashboard, go to your **Product → Plan**
2. Click **Get Link** in the top right
3. Copy the checkout URL

### Using checkout links

You can use checkout links in multiple ways:

- **Direct link** — Share the URL in emails, landing pages, or marketing campaigns
- **Button on your site** — Link your "Buy Now" or "Get Access" buttons to the checkout URL
- **With customer ID** — Append `?customer_id=unique-customer-001` to link the purchase to an existing customer

```html
<a href="https://checkout.kelviq.com/your-plan-id?customer_id=unique-customer-001">
  Buy Now
</a>
```

When a customer completes checkout, their subscription and entitlements are automatically available in Kelviq.

## 3. Check feature access

Once a customer completes a purchase, their entitlements are available in the SDK.
You can check feature access in the frontend (React SDK) or backend (Node SDK).
In all examples we’ll keep using the same customer ID: `unique-customer-001`.

### React: show or hide UI based on entitlements

```tsx
import { ShowWhenBooleanEntitled } from '@kelviq/react-sdk';

<ShowWhenBooleanEntitled
  featureKey="enable-dark-mode"
  loadingComponent={<p>Checking…</p>}
  fallback={<p>Dark mode not available</p>}
>
  <button>Toggle Dark Mode</button>
</ShowWhenBooleanEntitled>
```

### React: read all entitlements

```tsx
import { useAllEntitlements } from '@kelviq/react-sdk';

function EntitlementsList() {
  const { data: entitlements } = useAllEntitlements();

  return (
    <ul>
      {Object.values(entitlements).map(ent => (
        <li key={ent.featureKey}>
          {ent.featureKey}: {ent.hasAccess ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled'} ({ent.type})
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

### Backend check with Node

```ts
const ent = await client.entitlements.get({
  customerId: "unique-customer-001",
  featureKey: "max_upload_size_mb",
});

if (file.sizeMB > ent.value) {
  throw new Error("Upgrade required");
}
```

## 4. Report usage (metered features)

For metered features (like downloads, exports, AI generations, or API calls), send usage events from your backend.

```ts
import { BEHAVIOUR_CHOICES } from '@kelviq/node-sdk';

await client.reporting.reportUsage({
  customerId: "unique-customer-001",
  featureId: "downloads",
  value: 1,
  behaviour: BEHAVIOUR_CHOICES.INCREMENT, // or SET
});
```
