title: 'Dashboard setup'
---

Before you can integrate kelviq into your app, you need to configure your **products, plans, and features** in the dashboard.  
This setup defines how your pricing and entitlements will work.

---

## Create a product

1. In the sidebar, go to **Products → Create product**
2. Enter a product name (e.g., "Design Course", "Pro Plan", "Premium Templates")
3. Click **Save** — you'll be redirected to the product page  

---

## Create a plan

From the product page:  

1. Click **Create plan**  
2. Enter a plan name (e.g., “Basic Plan”)  
3. Click **Save** — you’ll be redirected to the plan details page  

---

## Add pricing to the plan

From the plan page, click the **Price** section to configure pricing:

1. Select billing cycles: **Monthly**, **Yearly**, **3 Months**, or **One Time**
2. Enter prices for each selected billing cycle
3. (Optional) Enable **Free trial** and set the trial period in days
4. Click **Save**

### Regional pricing

To offer localized prices in different currencies:

1. In the Price section, click **Add Region** under Regional Pricing
2. Select a currency (e.g., Indian Rupee, Euro)
3. Enter prices for each billing cycle in that currency
4. Click **Add Currency**

This allows you to set specific prices for different markets rather than relying on automatic currency conversion.

## Add digital downloads

If your plan includes downloadable content (e-books, software, course materials):

1. Click the **Digital downloads** section
2. Upload files that customers will receive after purchase
3. Files are securely delivered to customers upon successful payment

---

## Add license keys

To automatically generate unique license keys for each purchase:

1. Click the **License keys** section
2. Toggle license key generation **on**
3. Keys are automatically created and delivered to customers after purchase

You can use these keys to validate customers in your application.

---

## Add features and limits

Click the **Features & limits** section to configure feature access and usage quotas for this plan.

1. Click **Add feature**
2. A modal will open where you can create or select features
3. Configure the feature value for this plan

### Feature types

Features are created independently and can be attached to multiple plans with different values:

- **Switch (Boolean)** — on or off
  Examples: priority support, bonus content access, community access, custom branding

- **Customizable** — a fixed numeric limit, no usage reporting
  Examples: number of downloads, max projects, storage limit (10 GB, 100 GB)

- **Metered** — tracked consumption, usage events sent to Kelviq, resets each billing cycle
  Examples: API calls, AI generations, video renders, exports per month

Once added, features appear in the plan's feature list. You can reorder or remove them as needed.  

---

## Publish the plan

The last step is to publish your plan, so customers can see it and purchase it.

---

## Next steps

Your plan is now set up and synced with Stripe.
Next, you can integrate Kelviq into your app:

- Use **checkout links** to let customers purchase your plans
- Create a customer in Kelviq when a user signs up in your app
- Use the Kelviq **SDK** to check feature access and track usage
