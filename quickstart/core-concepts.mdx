Understanding these core concepts will make it easier to design your pricing and integrate the SDK.

---

## Products

A product is the main thing you sell.
Examples: "Cursor", "TimeMaster Pro", or "API Service".

---

## Features

A feature is a capability a customer can access. Features are defined once and can be reused across plans.

Examples: API access, AI tokens, storage space, priority support.

---

## Plans

A plan is how you package and price your product. You attach features and prices to a plan.

Examples: Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise.

[Learn more about plans →](/product-catalog/plans)

---

## Entitlements

Entitlements define how a customer can use a feature within a plan.

Examples:
- 1,000 API calls per month
- 10,000 AI tokens per month
- 100 GB storage space

Entitlements can be boolean (on/off), metered (usage limits), or config (custom values).

## Digital downloads

A digital download is a file that your customers can download after purchasing.

Examples: e-books, software, music, videos.

---

## License keys

A license key is a code that your customers can use to activate a digital download.

Examples: software activation, game keys, e-books.

---

## Links

Links allow you to share important URLs with customers after they purchase your plan.

Examples: Discord servers, Slack workspaces, Notion pages, member-only dashboards.

[Learn more about links →](/product-catalog/links)

---

## Customers

A customer is a person or company that purchases your product.

Typically, you create a customer record when someone signs up in your app.
When they complete a purchase, Kelviq maps the transaction to the customer record automatically.

## Typical workflows

### One-time products

Selling digital downloads, license keys, or access links:

1. Create a **product**
2. Create a **plan** with one-time pricing
3. Add **digital downloads**, **license keys**, or **links** to the plan
4. Share your checkout link or embed a pricing table
5. Customer purchases → receives their files, keys, and links

### SaaS subscriptions

Selling recurring access with feature limits:

1. Create **features** (e.g., API calls, storage, AI tokens)
2. Create a **product**
3. Create **plans** with recurring pricing (monthly/yearly)
4. Add **entitlements** to each plan (e.g., 1,000 API calls/month)
5. Integrate the **SDK** to check feature access and enforce limits
6. Customer subscribes → SDK controls what they can access

## Integrate with your app

To bring everything you set up in the dashboard into your app, use one of these options:

- **[SDKs](/frontend-integration/react-sdk)** — check feature access and enforce usage limits in code
- **[APIs](/api-reference/authentication)** — use for custom needs such as syncing usage or triggering upgrades

<Tip>
**No webhooks required.** Kelviq SDKs and UI widgets stay in sync automatically—no need to build webhook handlers or manage event processing.
</Tip>
