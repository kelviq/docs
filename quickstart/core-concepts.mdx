title: 'Core concepts'
---

Understanding these core concepts will make it easier to design your pricing and integrate the SDK.

---

## Products

A product is the main thing you sell.  
Examples: “Cursor”, “TimeMaster Pro”, or “API Service”.

---

## Features

A feature is a capability a customer can access. Features are defined once and can be reused across plans.  

Examples: API access, AI tokens, storage space, priority support.

---

## Plans

A plan is how you package and price your product. You attach features and prices to a plan.  

Examples: Free, Starter, Pro, Enterprise.

---

## Entitlements

Entitlements define how a customer can use a feature within a plan.  

Examples:  
- 1,000 API calls per month  
- 10,000 AI tokens per month  
- 100 GB storage space  

Entitlements can be boolean (on/off), metered (usage limits), or config (custom values).

## Digital downloads 

A digital download is a file that your customers can download after purchasing.

Examples: e-books, software, music, videos.

---

## License keys

A license key is a code that your customers can use to activate a digital download.

Examples: software activation, game keys, e-books.

---

## Customers

A customer is a person or company that purchases your product.

Typically, you create a customer record when someone signs up in your app.
When they complete a purchase, Kelviq maps the transaction to the customer record automatically.

---


## Integrate with your app

To bring everything you set up in the dashboard into your app, use one of these options:

- **SDKs** — check feature access and enforce usage limits in code  
- **UI widgets** — prebuilt components like Pricing Table, Paywall, and Customer Portal that update automatically when you change settings in the dashboard  
- **APIs** — use for custom needs such as syncing usage or triggering upgrades
